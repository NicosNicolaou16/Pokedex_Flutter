# The Project Contain the following technologies and libraries
[Dio Network Manager](https://pub.dev/packages/dio) is responsible for making requests and retrieving data from the remote server. <br />
[Drift Database](https://drift.simonbinder.eu/docs/getting-started/) is responsible for saving the retrieved data from the remote server, querying data from the local database, and supporting offline functionality. [Drift Database Documentation](https://pub.dev/packages/drift)  <br />
[Bloc Patterns using single state](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_bloc) along with repositories and services, separates business logic, data access, and UI by using streams to handle state and manage data flow. [Bloc Pattern Documentation](https://bloclibrary.dev/getting-started/) <br />
[Cached Network Image](https://pub.dev/packages/cached_network_image) is a package that it is responsible for loading the images and supports offline functionality.  <br />
[Palette](https://pub.dev/packages/palette_generator) is used to retrieve the color from the image; in our case, we are using the Pokémon color to paint the linear indicator with the same color.  <br />
[Get It (Dependencies Injection)](https://pub.dev/packages/get_it) is a lightweight dependency injection package for Flutter that allows you to register and access services globally, promoting cleaner and more maintainable code.  <br />
Hero Widget - https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/animations/hero-animations  <br />
The percentage for showing the skills of each Pokémon is calculated using the [percentages_with_animation](https://pub.dev/packages/percentages_with_animation) built by @NicosNicolaou16. <br />
